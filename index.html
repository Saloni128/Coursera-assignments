<h2><span class="green">Exercise</span></h2>
<p>Daily exercise is a good habit and important for a healthy mind and body. Forming healthy habits is easier said than done. Everyone want to be health and for that we have to work hard and push yourself. Making daily routine is very effective. Most of us have heard &quot;No pain, No gain...&quot;so don't get discourage because of poor performance. We can also make it fun by listening music, playing sports and by including dancing into it.</p>

<h2><span class="yellow">Reading</span></h2>
<p>The habit of reading is one of the best qualities that a person can possess. Books are known to be your best friend for a reason. Reading helps a great deal in building your confidence, reduces the stress and puts you in a better mood. Once you start reading books and make it your habit, you will eventually get addicted to it. Reading is the best kind of refreshment that you need from your hectic life schedule. So no matter how busy you get, do not forget to make time for you and your books. Now if you are a person who doesn’t read, well it’s never too late to start.</p>

<h2><span class="grey">To do list</span></h2>
<p>To do list bring structure in life and help us to manage time efficiently. Although we gave more time to social media and other unimportant things but making a list and planning tasks help us to feel organised and stay mentally focussed. It's most important benefit is prioritizing the tasks which ensures that we focus on the most important work rather than working on less important work. Once we have a list of the things we need to complete, we can set priorities and complete them.</p>
